LOUDBOT-SLACK
=============

LOUDBOT FOR [SLACK.COM](https://slack.com/) CHAT IS NOW KEEPING IT REALTIME.

I STOLE [ISAACS](https://github.com/isaacs)'S LOUDBOT AND TURNED IT INTO THIS. AT LEAST I DIDN'T USE PROMISES.

RUN THIS SOMEWHERE AND GIVE IT A SLACK API TOKEN IN THE `SLACK_API_TOKEN` ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE. YOU CAN PUT THAT INTO `.env` IF YOU LIKE OR SUPPLY IT ANY OTHER WAY YOU SEE FIT. YOU WILL NEED TO DEPLOY THIS IN A DIRECTORY WHERE IT HAS WRITE PERMISSIONS BECAUSE IT WANTS TO LEARN FROM YOUR SHOUTING.

IT WILL ALSO NEED A `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` BECAUSE SLACK APPS ARE MORE COMPLICATED THAN OLD LEGACY TOKENS BUT SOMEHOW BETTER BECAUSE WELL COMPARTMENTALIZED PERMISSIONS ARE A THING
